Overview of election audit
In this analysis we will find the voter turnout for each county. We will then calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count. Lastly, we will figure out the county with the highest turnout. After doing this we will be able to determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

Election-Audit Summary: Summary statement with a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used with some modifications for any election. Give two examples for how can be modified to be used for other elections.
The formula used to determine the results for this analysis can be implemented to find needed results in any election campaign. By changing the list of counties and candidates you can use the same layout to find results needed. You will be able to find the total of votes, percentage of votes for each county and candidate just as we did in this analysis.
